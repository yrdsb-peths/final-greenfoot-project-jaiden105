This game is a simple two-player shooter game you can play with a friend. The controls for Player 1 are the WASD keys and F to shoot, while Player 2's controls 
are the arrow keys and "enter" to shoot. To start playing the game, you need to press the spacebar. To win, a player needs to reach 5 points. A point can be gained
through winning a round by landing a bullet on the other player. Once a player wins, you will prompted the victory screen for that player, and to play again you need
to press spacebar to go back to the main menu screen.
